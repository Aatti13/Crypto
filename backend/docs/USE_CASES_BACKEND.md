# Use-Cases (Back-End):

## Backend Use Cases for Crypto Exchange Web App

---

## 1. **User Authentication & Profile Management**

**Description:**  
Allows users to register, log in, and manage their profiles securely. This includes features like password recovery, session management, and two-factor authentication (2FA).

**Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/auth/register` - Registers a new user.
- `POST /api/auth/login` - Authenticates the user and generates a JWT token.
- `POST /api/auth/reset-password` - Initiates password reset.
- `GET /api/auth/profile` - Retrieves user profile details (JWT-protected).

**Implementation Details:**
- **Authentication:** JWT tokens for session management.
- **Security:** Bcrypt.js for password encryption.
- **Database:** MongoDB stores user data including authentication tokens and profile information.
- **2FA:** Optional integration using libraries like `speakeasy` for time-based one-time passwords (TOTP).

## 2. **Crypto Trading**

**Description:**  
Provides users the ability to buy, sell, and trade cryptocurrencies. Transactions should be processed through third-party exchange APIs like Binance or Coinbase.

**Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/trades/prices` - Fetches real-time cryptocurrency prices.
- `POST /api/trades/place` - Places a new trade order (buy/sell).
- `GET /api/trades/history` - Retrieves transaction history for a user.

**Implementation Details:**
- **Trading API:** Integration with external APIs (Binance, Coinbase, etc.) for executing trades.
- **Real-time Data:** Socket.IO or WebSockets for real-time price updates.
- **Database:** MongoDB to store trade orders, transaction history, and user portfolio details.

## 3. **Portfolio Management**

**Description:**  
Allows users to track their cryptocurrency holdings, portfolio value, and view gains/losses based on market performance.

**Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/portfolio` - Retrieves current holdings and portfolio value.
- `POST /api/portfolio/update` - Updates the user’s portfolio with a new trade.
- `GET /api/portfolio/gains-losses` - Displays gain/loss reports based on historical data.

**Implementation Details:**
- **Database:** MongoDB stores holdings, portfolio metadata, and associated transactions.
- **Third-party API Integration:** Web3.js/Ethers.js to fetch wallet balances if external wallets are linked.

## 4. **Crypto News Feed**

**Description:**  
Aggregates and provides real-time news updates related to cryptocurrencies, allowing users to stay informed about market trends.

**Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/news` - Fetches latest cryptocurrency news articles.
- `GET /api/news/:topic` - Filters news by a specific topic or cryptocurrency.

**Implementation Details:**
- **News APIs:** Use third-party APIs like `NewsAPI` to aggregate cryptocurrency news.
- **Caching:** Redis for caching news articles to reduce repeated API calls and improve response times.
- **Database:** MongoDB for storing and indexing news articles.

## 5. **Educational Tutorials & Quizzes**

**Description:**  
Provides text, video tutorials, and quizzes for users to enhance their cryptocurrency knowledge. Tutorials are categorized by difficulty level, and quizzes offer feedback on user progress.

**Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/tutorials` - Fetches a list of available tutorials.
- `GET /api/tutorials/:id` - Retrieves details of a specific tutorial.
- `GET /api/tutorials/:id/quiz` - Fetches the associated quiz for a tutorial.
- `POST /api/tutorials/:id/quiz/submit` - Submits quiz answers and returns a score.

**Implementation Details:**
- **Database:** MongoDB stores tutorial content and quiz data.
- **Progress Tracking:** User quiz progress and tutorial completion are tracked via MongoDB documents.
- **Third-party Services:** Firebase (optional) for push notifications to remind users to complete their tutorials.

---

## 6. **Admin Dashboard**

**Description:**  
Admins can manage users, tutorials, and monitor the platform’s health. Admins can also moderate user-generated content, view analytics, and perform content management tasks.

**Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/admin/users` - Fetches a list of all users.
- `POST /api/admin/tutorials` - Allows an admin to create new tutorials.
- `DELETE /api/admin/users/:id` - Deletes a user from the system.
- `GET /api/admin/stats` - Retrieves platform usage analytics.

**Implementation Details:**
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Admin access managed via JWT tokens with specific roles (admin, moderator, etc.).
- **Data Visualization:** Aggregate data (tutorial completion, user activity) presented using MongoDB and processed for visual representation.
- **Security:** Sensitive actions protected by additional authentication layers (e.g., requiring admin confirmation).

---

## 7. **Blockchain Integration (Optional)**

**Description:**  
Allows users to connect external crypto wallets (e.g., MetaMask) to the platform for monitoring or trading purposes.

**Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/wallets/link` - Links a new crypto wallet to a user’s profile.
- `GET /api/wallets/balance` - Retrieves the current balance of a user’s linked wallet.
- `POST /api/wallets/transaction` - Initiates a blockchain transaction via the connected wallet.

**Implementation Details:**
- **Web3.js/Ethers.js:** Used to interact with Ethereum-based wallets.
- **Security:** Private keys are **never** stored on the platform. Wallets are connected through user interfaces like MetaMask.
- **Blockchain Data:** Transactions and balances are fetched via Ethereum or Bitcoin network nodes.

---

## 8. **Error Handling and Logging**

**Description:**  
Centralized error handling across all routes and APIs. Includes logging for critical actions like failed logins or trade errors.

**Implementation Details:**
- **Logging:** Use of `winston` or `morgan` for logging request details and errors.
- **Error Handling Middleware:** Centralized middleware in Express.js for consistent error response format.
- **Monitoring:** Tools like `Sentry` or `LogDNA` can be integrated for real-time error monitoring and alerting.
